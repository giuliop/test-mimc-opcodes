We test the new teal opcodes `mimc_BN254`, `mimc_BLS12_381` added to a fork
of go-algorand.

Run `make` to run the test; a private net as per the parameters at the top of
devnet.py has to be running with the forked node.

The makefile assumes you are using pipenv; if you are managing your python
enviroment some other way then you can either modify the makefile or use
`make compile` and then run main.py; just make sure the official python sdk
is available.
